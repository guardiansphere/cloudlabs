🔍 Purpose
CloudLabs is a hands-on project designed for building and testing cloud detection and response use cases using realistic attack scenarios in AWS and Azure environments.

With CloudLabs, security teams and researchers can:

Simulate real-world attacks such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and misconfiguration exploitation.

Develop and validate detection rules and alerts in both cloud-native and third-party SIEM/SOAR platforms.

Test automated response workflows using tools like Azure Logic Apps, AWS Step Functions, and more.

Explore cloud service behaviors under attack and leverage telemetry for defense.

💡 Each scenario includes an estimated cost per lab/day, enabling users to plan and spin up environments with cost awareness.

🚀 Features
Automated attack simulation playbooks

Ready-to-use detection rules for cloud threats

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for rapid lab setup

Integrations with cloud-native and third-party security tools

Cost estimation for each lab scenario

🧪 Available Labs
Azure Labs
Basic VM Lab: Deploys a Windows VM with RDP open for initial attack scenarios.

(More labs and AWS scenarios coming soon!)

🛠️ Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/guardiansphere/cloudlabs.git
cd cloudlabs
Choose a lab scenario from the available options (see /labs directory).

Follow the scenario instructions to deploy the environment and begin testing.

Note: Ensure you have the required permissions and cloud accounts (AWS/Azure) before deploying labs.
