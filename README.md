# Cloud Labs
It provides automated playbooks, detection rules, infrastructure as code (IaC) examples, and cloud-native integrations to help security teams rapidly defend against modern cloud attack scenarios.

## üîç Purpose
CloudLabs is a hands-on project focused on building and testing cloud detection and response use cases using realistic attack scenarios in AWS and Azure environments.

The goal is to provide a practical lab environment where security teams and researchers can:

Simulate real-world attacks such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and misconfig exploitation

Develop and validate detection rules and alerts in cloud-native and third-party SIEM/SOAR platforms

Test automated response workflows using tools like Azure Logic Apps, AWS Step Functions, and more

Explore how different cloud services behave under attack and how telemetry can be used for defense

üí∏ Note: Each scenario includes an estimated cost per lab/day, so users can plan and spin up environments with cost awareness.

## Azure Labs
- [Basic VM Lab](labs/azure/basic-vm-lab/README.md) ‚Äì Deploys a Windows VM with RDP open for initial attack scenarios.
